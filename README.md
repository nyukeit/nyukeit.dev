# Personal Portfolio Website Portfolio

I am glad you are here. There isn't much to see here for now. You could visit my website instead which is linked on the right.

I have started getting into Frontend and Full-Stack development and for now, this website is solely based on HTML and CSS. I will keep on upgrading this as time goes and I learn new things.

If you have a job for a Junior / Apprentice Web Developer with the MERN stack, I am happy to listen to remote offers or offers in South of France.
